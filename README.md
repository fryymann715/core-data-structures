# Core Data Structures

Tests and implementations for common data structures. 

This repo contains common data structures I wrote myself to get a better understanding of them. Most of them are written in JavaScript ES6, in order to familiarize myself with the new syntax available for building "classes". This project is rather on-going, and I use these data structures to re-orient myself to another langauge or to try out testing suites.
